# Posters by Maynard Gallery

A simple gallery single page app to show off some of my music poster work (aka "gigposters"). With over 500 flyers and posters I can't show them all, nor do I even have images for all of them tbh. I will probably limit this to a dozen or so. Intended to be a little bit of code practice but also a place to send potential clients for a portfolio.

### To-Do List

- Header with name, links to repo and social media
- Footer with copyright info, etc
- Main section with one main image and a carosel of images below.
- Tap/click on a poster thumbnail, get the details. Shocking!
- Each poster includes image, band names, location, date (?) when clicked.
- Responsive design / mobile first

### Extras / Random Ideas

- Background could reflect the color of the selected main image or possibly the same poster but blurry?
- Add links to band details
- Add search function (if the total number gets out of hand)

Thank you for reading and have a great day!
